    "- Make sure any tensors you make are moved to the GPU with .to(device) where device is “torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")”\n",
    "- Make sure you are passing a new hidden state for each training iteration, passing the same one will cause computation graph errors with Pytorch as it tries to accumulate the losses from all previous batches. The main loop of your training code should do the following, in this sequence:\n",
    "1. Apply the RNN to the incoming sequence\n",
    "2. Use the loss function to calculate the loss on the model’s output\n",
    "3. Zero the gradients of the optimizer\n",
    "4. Perform a backward pass (calling `.backward()`)\n",
    "5. Step the weights of the model via the optimizer (`.step()`)\n",
    "6. Add the current loss to the running loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**After every epoch, you should:**\n",
    "1. Sample a character with some randomness (this is up to you, you could sample from the dataset or you could sample uniformly from unique characters, or only capital letters, or any other variation).\n",
    "2. Print the result of the sampling to the output, so you can monitor the process of the training. Over time your generated text should become more and more “believable”. If not, something may be wrong with your implementation."
